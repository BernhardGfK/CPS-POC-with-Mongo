# CPS-POC-with-Mongo
This github repository contains a python script that generates dummy data for consumer panels, at least the data that is relevant for our POC.

The data is stored in three tables:
* Households\
Information about panelists participating in our panel
* Weights\
Weighting factors for these panelists for different periods of time
* Purchases\
The purchase data reported by our panelists, the data we want to report

I have also created three sample queries
* Transactions
* Trips
* Buyers
